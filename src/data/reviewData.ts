Its formula combines powerful plant-based oils known for their antifungal, antibacterial, and skin-nourishing properties.",
        "Kerassentials is applied directly to the affected nail and surrounding skin, where it absorbs quickly and starts working from the outside in. With consistent use, it helps improve nail appearance, support healthier nail growth, and restore smoother, clearer skin around the toes.",
        "The product is made with natural ingredients, free from aggressive chemicals, and designed for daily use without discomfort. It is suitable for men and women who want a gentle yet effective solution for nail fungus without relying on prescriptions or invasive treatments.",
        "In short, Kerassentials offers a natural, practical approach to improving nail health while supporting long-term protection against recurring fungal issues."

export const FAQS = [
    {
        q: "Why isn't the original Kerassentials sold on Amazon, Walmart, or eBay?",
        a: "To be direct: to avoid what we call 'fungal fertilization'. Intelligence reports from January 2026 confirm that pirate bottles on marketplaces use inert stable oils (like low-quality canola or soy). These oils don't penetrate the nail; they just create a layer of moisture that feeds the fungus. To ensure you receive the Authorized 2026 Batch with USP-grade Undecylenic Acid, the manufacturer has banned third-party sales. Buying here is the only way to get the real formula and official support."
    },
    {
        q: "Is Kerassentials FDA approved?",
        a: "In the USA, the FDA doesn't 'approve' cosmetics or topical oils the same way it approves prescription drugs. What we do is more rigorous: Kerassentials is produced in an FDA-Registered and GMP Certified (Good Manufacturing Practices) facility. This transparency is what sets us apart from products that make 'magic' promises without following federal hygiene and purity standards."
    },
    {
        q: "Is there any trick to accelerate results?",
        a: "Yes. Nail science shows that the nail plate is a dense barrier. We recommend what experts call the '3-Minute Post-Shower Technique'. Apply the oil immediately after getting out of a warm shower, when the keratin protein is most malleable and skin pores are open. This allows the 8 ingredients to penetrate deep into the nail bed, instead of just sitting on the surface."
    },
    {
        q: "How long until I see total clearance?",
        a: "Biology doesn't rush. While many of our 14,357+ users report improvement in texture within 21 days, total renewal of a damaged nail takes 3 to 6 months. It's a matter of biological logic that the 6-bottle package (with the real 72.63% discount) is our technical recommendation: it covers the full growth cycle without giving the fungus a chance to build resistance due to interrupted use."
    },
    {
        q: "What if my biology is the exception and it doesn't work?",
        a: "The financial risk is 100% ours. You have a 60-Day Money-Back Guarantee, processed directly by BuyGoods. If you don't notice the spots fading or the nail getting stronger, simply request a refund. We don't ask hard questions. We keep this policy because satisfaction data for the current batch is the highest in the product's history."
    },
    {
        q: "Can I use it with nail polish or other products?",
        a: "You can, but for maximum performance, the nail should be 'naked'. Kerassentials needs direct contact. If you need to use nail polish, apply the oil, wait 5 minutes for full absorption, and then apply the polish. The goal is to create an environment where the fungus cannot survive, and direct penetration is key."
