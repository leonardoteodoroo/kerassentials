        "Unlike creams or harsh treatments that only work on the surface, Kerassentials was developed to target the root cause of fungal growth by creating an environment where fungus struggles to survive. Its formula combines powerful plant-based oils known for their antifungal, antibacterial, and skin-nourishing properties.",
        "Kerassentials is applied directly to the affected nail and surrounding skin, where it absorbs quickly and starts working from the outside in. With consistent use, it helps improve nail appearance, support healthier nail growth, and restore smoother, clearer skin around the toes.",
        "The product is made with natural ingredients, free from aggressive chemicals, and designed for daily use without discomfort. It is suitable for men and women who want a gentle yet effective solution for nail fungus without relying on prescriptions or invasive treatments.",
        "In short, Kerassentials offers a natural, practical approach to improving nail health while supporting long-term protection against recurring fungal issues."

export const FAQS = [
    {
        q: "Why can't I find Kerassentials on Amazon or Walmart?",
        a: "To ensure the total integrity of the 8-in-1 formula, the manufacturer chose not to distribute Kerassentials on marketplaces like Amazon or Walmart. Intelligence reports [Source: Morningstar] confirm the circulation of inauthentic and diluted batches on these platforms. By buying only through this Official Site, you ensure the original product, the 2026 batch freshness seal, and full refund rights."
    },
    {
        q: "Is Kerassentials really safe and FDA approved?",
        a: "Kerassentials is formulated with 100% natural ingredients and produced in the USA in FDA-Registered and GMP Certified facilities. It is important to note that, as it is classified as a cosmetic/topical oil, the FDA regulates its safety and manufacturing but does not 'approve' dietary supplements or cosmetics individually. This transparency is what differentiates us from products that make miraculous promises without regulatory basis."
    },
    {
        q: "How long until I see visible results?",
        a: "Nail biology requires patience, not miracles. While many of our 14,357+ users report improvements in clarity and texture within the first few weeks, deeper results occur after 3 to 6 months of consistent use. The key is daily application to allow the Tea Tree and Clove oils to penetrate the nail bed. Therefore, the 6-bottle package (with 72.63% discount) is the most recommended choice for a complete renewal cycle."
    },
    {
        q: "What happens if I am not satisfied?",
        a: "Your trust is protected by a 60-Day Money-Back Guarantee, no questions asked. If for any reason you feel Kerassentials is not for you, simply contact our official support (or directly via the BuyGoods payment processor) to receive a full refund of your investment. The risk is entirely on our side; your only job is to test the formula and see the difference on your feet."
