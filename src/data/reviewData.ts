export const FAQS = [
    {
        q: "Will it stain my socks or shoes?",
        a: "No. Kerassentials is formulated to absorb quickly into the skin and nail. Wait about 3-5 minutes after application before putting on socks to ensure it has fully penetrated. Once dry, it helps keep skin fresh without leaving greasy residue or stains."
    },
    {
        q: "How exactly do I apply it?",
        a: "It's simple: 1) Clean and dry your feet. 2) Apply the oil to the nail and surrounding skin using the included brush. 3) Let it absorb for a few minutes. Repeat this 4 times a day (twice in the morning, twice in the afternoon) for best results."
    },
    {
        q: "Is this a subscription?",
        a: "No, this is a one-time payment. There are no hidden auto-ship programs or monthly charges. You only pay for what you order today."
    },
    {
        q: "Who should NOT use it?",
        a: "Kerassentials is made with natural ingredients and is generally safe. However, if you have a known allergy to essential oils (like tea tree or clove) or are pregnant/nursing, we recommend consulting your doctor first. Do not use on open wounds."
    },
    {
        q: "Can I use it with other treatments?",
        a: "We generally recommend using Kerassentials on its own to allow the formula to work effectively without interference. If you are using prescribed medication, please consult your healthcare provider before combining treatments."
    },
    {
        q: "Why isn't the original Kerassentials sold on Amazon, Walmart, or eBay?",
        a: "To be direct: to avoid what we call 'fungal fertilization'. Intelligence reports from January 2026 confirm that pirate bottles on marketplaces use inert stable oils (like low-quality canola or soy). These oils don't penetrate the nail; they just create a layer of moisture that feeds the fungus. To ensure you receive the Authorized 2026 Batch with USP-grade Undecylenic Acid, the manufacturer has banned third-party sales. Buying here is the only way to get the real formula and official support."
    },
    {
        q: "Is Kerassentials FDA approved?",
        a: "In the USA, the FDA doesn't 'approve' cosmetics or topical oils the same way it approves prescription drugs. What we do is more rigorous: Kerassentials is produced in an FDA-Registered and GMP Certified (Good Manufacturing Practices) facility. This transparency is what sets us apart from products that make 'magic' promises without following federal hygiene and purity standards."
    },
    {
        q: "How long until I see total clearance?",
        a: "Biology doesn't rush. While many of our 14,357+ users report improvement in texture within 21 days, total renewal of a damaged nail takes 3 to 6 months. It's a matter of biological logic that the 6-bottle package (with the real 72.63% discount) is our technical recommendation: it covers the full growth cycle without giving the fungus a chance to build resistance due to interrupted use."
    },
    {
        q: "What if my biology is the exception and it doesn't work?",
        a: "The financial risk is 100% ours. You have a 60-Day Money-Back Guarantee, processed directly by BuyGoods. If you don't notice the spots fading or the nail getting stronger, simply request a refund. We don't ask hard questions. We keep this policy because satisfaction data for the current batch is the highest in the product's history."
